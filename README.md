# Newton_method_finding_roots
Newtonâ€™s Method is an iterative algorithm used to find roots of equations or optimize functions.

It updates the estimate of a minimizer as

$$
x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f'(x_k)}{f''(x_k)}
$$

This can be used to find solutions for a non-linear equation.
Applications could be to solve for the inverse kinematics for a 2_D manipulator!
